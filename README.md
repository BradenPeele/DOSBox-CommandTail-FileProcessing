testFile.TXT is an example of how an input file will need to be formatted

-the program first gets the filename and a numeral from the command tail
-input file and output file will be opened 
-the input file contains a name followed by a numeral
-the program will parse the input file and the names with numerals larger than the one specified in the command tail will be added to the output file
-a timer diplays how long the program takes to complete
